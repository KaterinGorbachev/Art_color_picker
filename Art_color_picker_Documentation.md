## Pages Header


Each Page contains a header menu with a search bar, drop-down menu and multiple navigation links. 

Multiple navigation links: 

    - ART COLOR PICKER: A clickable text link that redirects users back to the Home Page.

    - PALLETES: A link to the Palettes Page, where color combinations are displayed in an organized manner, following the structure of a reference book.

    - RANDOM: A link that generates three random palettes. Each click on the "Random" link generates a new set of palettes:

        - One palette with 2 colors

        -   One palette with 3 colors

        - One palette with 4 colors

    - COLORS: A link to the Colors Page, where colors are categorized by groups.

- Search Bar: The search bar allows users to enter a maximum of 9 characters, including only the "#" symbol, numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z). Any other characters are not accepted. 

The program processes the input by removing the "#" symbol and converting it into an RGB format to: 
    - Retrieve matching colors from the database
    - Suggest similar colors if the exact match is unavailable, allowing users to select from existing color options in the database.

- Drop-down Menu: a drop-down menu provides additional navigation options and user preferences.
